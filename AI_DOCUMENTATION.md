## 4. Key Files

- **`index.html`**: The entry point for the web app. It includes the Tailwind CSS configuration and the main script.
- **`App.tsx`**: The root React component that manages the main state and renders other components.
- **`capacitor.config.ts`**: Configures Capacitor settings, such as the app ID and name.
- **`package.json`**: Defines project scripts (`dev`, `build`, `cap:sync`, etc.) and dependencies.
- **`components/`**: Contains all the reusable React components that make up the UI.
- **`android/`**: The native Android project. This directory should not be modified directly, as it is managed by Capacitor.

## 5. Styling and UI

The app uses a dark theme with a `slate` color palette and neon accents for interactive elements.

- **Background:** `#020617` (slate-950)
- **Primary UI Panels:** `#0f172a` (slate-900), `#151f32` (slate-850)
- **Accent Colors:**
  - **Blue:** `#06b6d4` (neon-blue)
  - **Purple:** `#d946ef` (neon-purple)
  - **Green:** `#22c55e` (neon-green)
  - **Red:** `#ef4444` (neon-red)
- **Gradient:** A gradient from `neon-blue` to `neon-purple` is used for primary buttons.

The UI is built with custom components and styled directly with Tailwind CSS classes.

## 6. Core Functionality

- **Workout Logging:** Users can log new workout sessions by providing the date and calories burned.
- **Exercise Types:** Users can select from a list of predefined exercises or add their own.
- **Session Editing/Deleting:** Existing sessions can be edited or deleted.
- **Statistics:** The app displays key stats like total workouts, average calories, etc.
- **Trend Chart:** A chart visualizes the user's calorie burn over the last 20 sessions.

## 7. Build and Deployment

### Web
- **Development:** `npm run dev`
- **Production Build:** `npm run build` (output is in the `dist` directory)

### Android
1.  **Build Web Assets:** `npm run build`
2.  **Sync with Capacitor:** `npx cap sync`
3.  **Run on Device:** `ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" npx cap run android --target=<device_id>`

**Note on Wireless Debugging:**
- The connection can be unstable, especially with a VPN active.
- If the device is not found, the user needs to re-pair and re-connect using `adb pair` and `adb connect`.

### iOS
(Instructions are similar to Android, but require a macOS machine with Xcode installed)
1.  **Add iOS platform:** `npx cap add ios`
2.  **Build Web Assets:** `npm run build`
3.  **Sync with Capacitor:** `npx cap sync`
4.  **Open in Xcode:** `npx cap open ios`
5.  **Run from Xcode:** Build and run the app on a simulator or a connected device.
